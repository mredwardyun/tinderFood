#Dev Guidelines
.. Branches: We will have a master branch that will include the main functionality of the project and test, but we will create new branches
                for additional features until they are complete.
.. Code Style: We will comment our code thoroughly if we feel that what we have done isn't self-explanatory, and we will not change another
                team member's code without first discussing it with that team member.
.. Test reqs: We will thoroughly test our code, and we will test as we development. The master branch should be tested before any additional
                features are added and all additionally features should be tested before they are merged into master. Each user story should
                be tested thoroughly before it is marked as completed and we start the next one
.. Other stuff: n/a
