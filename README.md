#Dev Guidelines

Branches: We will have a master branch that will include the main functionality of the 
project and test, but we will create new branches for additional features until they 
are complete.


Code Style: We will comment our code thoroughly if we feel that what we have done isn't 
self-explanatory, and we will not change another team member's code without first 
discussing it with that team member.


Test reqs: We will thoroughly test our code, and we will test as we development. The 
master branch should be tested before any additional features are added and all 
additionally features should be tested before they are merged into master. Each user 
story should be tested thoroughly before it is marked as completed and we start the next one


Other stuff: n/a
